# Commit workflow

When the user says "commit these changes" (or equivalent):

1. **Update docs first**  
   Review the changes (e.g. `git diff`, `git status`). If they add or change behavior, options, or usage, update the relevant docs (e.g. README, manpage in `src/main.rs`, INSTALL.md) so the docs match the code. Only then proceed to commit.

2. **Then commit**  
   Stage and commit with an appropriate message (e.g. conventional commit format if the project uses it).

Do not commit until docs have been updated when the changes warrant it.
